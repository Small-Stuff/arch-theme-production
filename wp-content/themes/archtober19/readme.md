#### Updates [in progress/TK]

	- CFA: pencil / crayon or something else for edu… no eyes.

LEH	questions:

- is the intro loading still happening for them when they go back to the homepage from an event?
	///// yes
- is the menu icon still disappearing for them?
	//// yes

**SS NOTE: review body text hierarchy to see if it fits w all their needs [they are adding sample content ]**

**LEH to check extra/errant “building name” field on event page back end (which doesn’t seem to effect pages or content)**
